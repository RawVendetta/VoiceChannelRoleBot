# Discord Role Alert Bot

## Description

Discord Role Alert Bot is a Python script that monitors users joining voice channels in a Discord server and alerts them if they are missing a certain role. It provides a seamless way to guide users to read the server rules and automatically grant them the missing role once they react to the rules message.

This bot is intended to enhance community engagement and ensure that all members are aware of the server rules while providing a convenient mechanism to comply with the rules and gain the necessary roles.

## Features

- Monitors voice channel joins to check for missing roles.
- Sends alerts to users with missing roles, directing them to read the server rules.
- Listens for reactions on the rules message and grants the missing role to users who accept the rules.
- Customizable settings to specify the voice channels and role assignment behavior.
